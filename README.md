Trigonometric functions: Sine, cosine, tangent (with toggling between radians and degrees)<br>
Hyperbolic functions: Sine, cosine, tangent<br>
Logarithms: Natural logarithm (ln), logarithm base 10 (log10) <br>
Exponents: e^x, 10^x, x^y, x^2, x^3 <br>
Roots: Square root, cube root, y-th root <br>
Factorial <br>
Random number generation <br>
Special Feature: Confetti explosion for operations involving 5 and 6 as operands.<br>
Memory Functions: Store, recall, and clear memory.<br>
Parentheses: Support for grouping expressions.<br>
Scientific Notation: EE button for entering numbers in scientific notation.<br>
Theme Switcher: Toggle between light and dark modes.<br>
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.<br>

# Usage
Basic Operations <br>
Use the numeric buttons (0-9) and operation buttons (+, -, *, รท) to perform basic calculations. <br>
The "C" button clears the current input and result.<br>
Advanced Functions<br>
Toggle between primary and secondary functions using the 2nd button. <br>
Use the angle mode toggle (Rad/Deg) to switch between radians and degrees for trigonometric functions. <br>
Use the scientific notation button (EE) to enter numbers in scientific notation. <br>
Memory Functions <br>
MS (Memory Store): Stores the current result in memory. <br>
MR (Memory Recall): Recalls the stored memory value. <br>
MC (Memory Clear): Clears the stored memory value.<br> 

# Special Feature
1. Any operation involving 5 and 6 as operands (e.g., 5 + 6, 5 * 6) will trigger a confetti explosion on the screen. <br>
2. Theme Switcher <br>
   Use the toggle switch at the top right to switch between light and dark themes. <br>
Responsive Design <br>
The app is designed to be fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. <br>
